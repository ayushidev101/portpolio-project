# portpolio-project
This is a project that I developed as part of the Meta Front End Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera (HTML and CSS in depth). 
The idea was to create a landing page for a fictitious client, in my case, Little Lemon, a restaurant that serves healthy and delicious food.
